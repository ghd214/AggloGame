This is a fun project to learn Paper.js and simple 2D game mechanics.
Originally this game was built with Processing as a school assignment many years ago and can be viewed [here](http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/32751, "Open Processing")(JavaPlugin req.).

This is my attempt to rebuild the game using new techniques, make it more efficient, and add new modes and abilities.
